# Prototype Pattern Sample Implementation in C#

This repository provides a sample implementation of the Prototype design pattern in C#. The Prototype pattern is a creational design pattern that allows objects to be created by cloning existing objects, thereby reducing the cost of new instance creation when it is more expensive or complex.

## Features

- Interface `IShape` with a `Clone` method that all shapes must implement, following the Prototype pattern.
- Concrete shape classes like `Rectangle` and `Circle` that implement the `Clone` method.
- Copy constructors in each shape class ensure cloned objects maintain the same state as the original objects.
- A `Render` method in each shape class to simulate the rendering of the shape, showcasing potential functionality of the shapes.

## Getting Started

To run the code in this repository, ensure you have a C# development environment such as Visual Studio or VSCode with the .NET SDK installed.

### Prerequisites

- .NET SDK
- A C# compatible IDE or editor

### Running the Code

After cloning the repository, open the solution file in your IDE and build the project. You can then run the application to see the Prototype pattern in action as it clones and renders shapes.

## Sample Explanation

In this sample:

- Each shape (like `Rectangle` and `Circle`) implements the `IShape` interface, which defines the `Clone` method necessary for following the Prototype pattern.
- The `Clone` method for each concrete shape returns a new instance of the shape, effectively creating a copy with identical state.
- Copy constructors within each concrete shape class are utilized to guarantee that the cloned objects are instantiated with the same data as the original objects, ensuring a true clone.
- The `Render` method is included to represent some functionality that might be associated with these concrete shape classes, like rendering the shape on a canvas or display.

## Usage

This implementation can be used as a reference for understanding and applying the Prototype pattern in your own C# projects. You can expand upon these concepts by adding more complex state management, integrating with a rendering engine, or applying the pattern to other object hierarchies.

## Contributing

Contributions to this sample are welcome. Whether it's extending the implementation, improving the existing code, or fixing bugs, please feel free to fork the repository, make changes, and submit a pull request.
