In this sample:
- Each shape implements the IShape interface, which defines the Clone method, following the Prototype pattern.
- The Clone method for each shape returns a new instance of the shape, effectively making a copy.
- Copy constructors are used to ensure that the new objects are created with the same data as the existing objects.
- The Render method is there to demonstrate some functionality that might be associated with the concrete shape classes.
